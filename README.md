## Usage

   - For testing purposes, you can log in with the following **test account** credentials:
     - **Email**: `habito.test.user@gmail.com`
     - **Password**: `Ypy0aalZ9HI3`
   - This account is already connected to Google, so you can use it to check the full functionality, including habit tracking and Google Calendar integration.

## Features

- **User Authentication:**
  - Users can log in using **Google OAuth** or create an account with **credentials** (email & password).
  
- **Habit Creation and Management:**
  - Users can **create habits** within the app, define their frequency (daily, weekly, etc.), and link them to their **Google Calendar**.
  - A user can **edit habits** in the app, and it will automatically update in the connected Google Calendar.
  - **Unlink** habits from Google Calendar while keeping the habit persistent in the app.

- **Google Calendar Integration:**
  - **Add habits to Google Calendar** from the app with the option to choose the **title, color, and frequency**.
  - **Real-time synchronization** ensures any changes made in the app (adding, updating, or deleting habits) reflect in the Google Calendar.
  - **Embedded Google Calendar** to display all user habits, updating in real time as changes are made.

- **Habit Categories & Scheduling:**
  - Habits are categorized into sections based on the time of day: **Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night**, and **Unorganized**.

- **Habit Completion Tracking:**
  - Users can mark habits as **done** for each day, with visual feedback and stats tracking progress.

- **Weather Integration:**
  - The app fetches **real-time weather data** based on the userâ€™s **geolocation** (using **Geolocation-DB**).
  - **OpenWeather API** is used to fetch the current weather conditions, weather details are shown dynamically to the user, enhancing the habit-tracking experience.
  - 
- **Responsive Design:**
  - The app is fully responsive, using **Bootstrap** and **SCSS** for styling, providing a smooth experience across different devices.

- **No Page Reloads:**
  - The app is built with **AJAX** and **JavaScript**, ensuring **real-time updates** without the need for page reloads.
